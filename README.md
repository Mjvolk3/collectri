# BioCypher adapter for the CollecTRI dataset

This repository contains the code for the BioCypher adapter for the CollecTRI
dataset. The adapter is a Python module that converts the CollecTRI dataset into
the BioCypher format. It also serves as a tutorial for end-to-end knowledge
graph construction using BioCypher.

## Process

1. Download and cache the resource

2. Run BioCypher to create knowledge graph

3. Deploy knowledge graph and web frontend

## Tutorial

1. Create repository: using the template repository is the easiest way to get
started. The [template
repository](https://github.com/biocypher/project-template) contains the basic
structure of a BioCypher adapter. Clone the template repository and rename it
and the adapter to your project's name. Also adjust the `pyproject.toml` file to
reflect your project's name and version.
